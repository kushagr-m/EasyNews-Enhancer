## Install Instructions
NHK Easy News Enhancer is a userscript and thus requires a userscript manager to run. If you have one already, skip step 0.

0. Install a userscript manager extension. (e.g. Violentmonkey: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)/[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)/[Opera](https://adfdons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/))
1. [**Download script**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theKKCD/EasyNews-Enhancer/master/EasyNews-Enhancer.user.js) and install it in your userscript manager (in VM, click `Confirm Installation`)
2. (Optional) **Install the font** [`Noto Sans CJK JP Regular`](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-cjk/raw/master/NotoSansCJKjp-Regular.otf). This is used to make text more legible on the site.

Go to [NHK News Web Easy](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/index.html) to use.
